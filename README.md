# TheThirdPole Map Data Repository
[TheThirdPole.net](http://thethirdpole.net) thethirdpole.net is an online forum providing accessible, high-quality information and analysis on all aspects of transboundary water in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region. It was launched in 2009  as a project of chinadialogue, in partnership with Internews Earth Journalism Network and fosters constructive debate on the sustainable management of these vital resources. 

The Hindu Kush - Himalaya region is known as the Third Pole because it contains the largest reserve of ice outside the polar regions. This area is the headwaters of the 10 major river systems that provide irrigation, power and drinking water for over 1.3 billion people – nearly 20% of the world’s population. 

##Styled vs Unstyled Files
Working in collaboration with partners across the Hindu Kush Himalaya region and the world, [TheThirdPole.net](http://thethirdpole.net) has created maps designs and tiles to highlight the region's watersheds and the stress on them. This repository contains design files mostly. Geospatial data is either available from the indicated data source or provided publicly via [data.thethirdpole.net](http://data.thethirdpole.net). 

##Maps
Each of the maps contained in this repository include a two files for map design (cartoCSS and SLD) an mbtiles file, and an HTML map legend. A csv file describes how the layers are organized as well as their interactivity as defined in the JEO Wordpess platform.

####Croplands

The [Global Croplands](https://croplands.org/) dataset was created with data such as Landsat and Modis imagery using remote sensing techniques by analyzing millions of image pixels. For example, we combine temporal patterns of the Normalized Vegetation Difference Index(NVDI) with our reference data to classify the world's cropland by the following measures.

⋅⋅*Cropland or NonCropland
⋅⋅*Irrigation or Rainfed
⋅⋅*Crop Types
⋅⋅*Intensity of Cropland

####Livestock Density
Data on livestock distributions (cattle, chicken, duck, pig, sheep & goat) were used to create  density. Sourced from the [Livestock Geo-Wiki](http://livestock.geo-wiki.org/) created by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB-LUBIES)
