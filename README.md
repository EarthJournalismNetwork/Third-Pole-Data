# TheThirdPole Map Data Repository
[TheThirdPole.net](http://thethirdpole.net) thethirdpole.net is an online forum providing accessible, high-quality information and analysis on all aspects of transboundary water in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region. It was launched in 2009  as a project of chinadialogue, in partnership with Internews Earth Journalism Network and fosters constructive debate on the sustainable management of these vital resources. 

The Hindu Kush - Himalaya region is known as The Third Pole because it contains the largest reserve of fresh water outside the polar regions. This is the source of the 10 major river systems that provide irrigation, power and drinking water for over 1.3 billion people – nearly 20% of the world’s population. 

##Styled vs Unstyled Files
Working in collaboration with partners across the Hindu Kush Himalaya region and the world, [TheThirdPole.net](http://thethirdpole.net) has created maps designs and tiles to highlight the region's watersheds and the stress on them. This repository contains design files mostly. Geospatial data is either available from the indicated data source or provided publicly via [data.thethirdpole.net]{http://data.thethirdpole.net).
